This is a simple personal portfolio website built using HTML and basic CSS.
The project showcases my profile, skills, and projects in a clean and responsive layout.
It was created to practice front-end fundamentals such as semantic HTML structure, CSS styling, layout design, and basic responsiveness.

This portfolio serves as a foundation for future improvements, where additional features, animations, and JavaScript functionality can be added
